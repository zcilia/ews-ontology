# Early Warning System Scores (EWSSO) Ontology

The Early Warning System Scores Ontology (EWSSO) is an ontology for representing three commonly used EWSs: the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), the 6-item modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA).  The EWSSO can be used to facilitate integration of data on vital signs and calculation of the NEWS, six item MEWS, and qSOFA scores using disparate data sources.
